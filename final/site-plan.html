        Welcome to the Foutz Family Memories Page! This page is a collection of memories, pictures, and videos of the Foutz Family. Family members are welcome to submit any pictures or memories they have! I have so much love for my family, and so I created this website to be able to have a place to reminisce and for others to share their favorite memories too! It really is a special thing to have such a loving family, and so I know God blessed me with this incredible family I have!

      <h3>Foutz Family Videos</h3>
      <p>
        The Foutz Family has annual family reunions, complete with reunion music videos from 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, and 2023. We used songs such as “Call Me Maybe,” “Shake It Off,” “Can’t Stop The Feeling,” and “The Greatest Show.” Some of my best memories come from these reunions that included many hikes, game nights, delicious dinners, and more. Any Foutz you ask would tell you all about our hikes, especially “Foutz Miles.” Even those who didn’t like hiking (like me) went to spend time with their cousins and family because it made the hard hikes worth it! Game nights were my favorite highlight of reunions. Most nights, all the cousins we could fit in a big room would squeeze in and sit in a big circle to play the group game “Signs.” So many of my favorite memories came from these games and I love looking back fondly and remembering all the funny moments. Dinners were different every reunion, and this is because the Foutz sibling in charge changed every year. My Grandma and Grandpa Foutz were blessed with 10 children, most of whom participate in these reunions, which makes the reunions big and filled with love. The metaphorical “baton” passes down the line from the oldest to the youngest over 10 years.

        Another Foutz Family tradition that I've always loved is gathering around Christmas time. Christmas celebrations with the Foutz Family include our annual Christmas Party, gathering on Christmas Eve around the piano, and more. Every year, we have our annual Christmas Party. It’s filled with delicious food, a White Elephant gift exchange, and an exciting visit from Santa himself. The food is often lots of warm homemade dishes and even better desserts, which is one of my favorite parts. For the White Elephant gift exchange, all of the cousins in attendance participate! Everyone brings a gift worth $5 or less, and it honestly is so much fun. Everyone tries their best to make sure that everyone is having a good time, but there are often tears from the younger kids because they might not have gotten the gift they wanted. My absolute favorite part of the family Christmas party is the special visit from Santa Claus. One of my uncles or older cousins gets to dress up in the family’s Santa Claus costume and visit with stockings for everyone. When I was younger, I would speculate with my cousins about which family member would be Santa Claus this year, but as I got older, it became apparent as one uncle or cousin would disappear about 20 or 30 minutes before Santa came to visit. The stockings often had homemade cookies, Capri Suns, Christmas chocolate, and many more treats. Some of my best memories with my cousins included emptying our stockings as we sat in a circle and traded for our favorite things. Another one of my favorite Christmas traditions included going to my Grandma’s house and sitting in the living room around the piano as we sang Christmas songs and went over the Christmas story in the Bible!
