    <h2>Emma MacKay</h2>
    <p>My name is Emma MacKay and I'm from Las Vegas, Nevada. I have never lived anywhere else until I moved up here to Rexburg. My major is CIT and I hope to learn many new and exciting things.</p>
    <p>My parents had six children, all raised in the Church, and I am the youngest. I have two older brothers and three older sisters. I also have two nephews and one niece. I am not married, but I do currently have a boyfriend who lives back in Las Vegas. It will be our 1 year anniversary in November.</p>
    <p>I am currently starting a job at Cafe Rio Mexican Grill as a tortilla worker. Back in Las Vegas, I worked at Crumbl Cookies as a baker for about a year. Although I loved Crumbl because of my amazing coworkers and managers, I want to make a career in either Webdesign or Computer Information Technology.</p>
    <p>Thank you for looking at my webpage!</p>
